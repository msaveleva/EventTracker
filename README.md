Event Tracker for Guild Wars 2
============

This is the app for tracking game events in Guild Wars 2. It fetches data from ArenaNet servers, parses it with the Mantle framework and displays it to the user.  
Despite the large amount of work done, the project was frozen and it is still on github to compare my programming level in 2014 to its present level.
